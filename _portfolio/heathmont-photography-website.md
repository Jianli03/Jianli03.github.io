This is a voluntary project for me to build a website for Heathmont Photographic Group.

{% include gallery caption="This is how it displays on different platform." %}
The group is one of the groups of Heathmont Uniting Church Community Lifestyle Centre. This website hosts events for annual Photography Competition and Display. This is a good opportunity for me to practice the HTML/CSS3/Bootstrap and web design skills to build a responsive modern website. We are still looking for a place to host it.

## Following are some thought about this work:

### Web app is not a sliver bullet.
![image-right](/images/bootstrap.jpg){: .align-right}
I firstly used bootstrap in an android app project to make our app work across platforms. Bootstrap is a good framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. However, our app required a huge amount of data communication between front-end and back-end. It ran very slow in a web application form using android’s webview. We should have built it as a native app.

Nowadays millions of amazing sites across the web are being built with Bootstrap. You can get started on your own
with their growing <a href="../getting-started/#examples">collection of examples</a> on the bootstrap's website.

### Font Awesome

Font Awesome provides scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized —
size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

##### One More Step
A creative way to use those icons is to install the font in your Word or WPS, in order to insert them into your document as symbols. It saves me a lot of time to find a proper icon when needing it in a document and makes the style trendy.

Running List of Programs that Allow Font Awesome
* Microsoft Excel
* PowerPoint
* Word
* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* After Effects
* Premiere Pro


### Humanstxt

This small text file doesn’t help your website in a technical way, but is just an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. The TXT file contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

I love its spirit. It promotes that the Internet is for humans. The only aim of this initiative is to know who the authors of the sites we visit are. You don’t have to if you don’t want to.

Here is their website. I am glad to see that there is an extension of this org in China.

There is a Chrome Plugin for humantxt to see if there is humantxt provided by a site.

The project is supported by Heathmont Community Centre. Here is their old fashion website,

Maybe I should be working on it as well :)
